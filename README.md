# Word Sorting Script

## Description
This Python script sorts words from a provided text file. If the file is not found, it defaults to a built-in list of fruits.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python main.py <filename>
```
Replace `<filename>` with the name of your text file containing words to be sorted. Each word should be on a new line.

## Makefile Commands
- `make run`: Executes the script using the default words list.
- `make clean`: Removes all `.txt` files in the directory.
